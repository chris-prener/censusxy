The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy access to the [U.S. Census Bureau Geocoding Tools](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) in `R`. `censusxy` has also been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so that a single object is returned. There is also support for parallel processing of requests, which can significantly shorten the time it takes to batch geocode large numbers of addresses.

`censusxy` is described in a 2021 paper in [*Transactions in GIS*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12741) by Chris and Branson - please cite the paper if you use `censusxy` in your work!

## Current Development Status
While the current, core functionality still works, changes in the Census API caused consistent issues with our unit tests, prompting us to remove the package from CRAN. As of early 2025, there is no active development planned for `censusxy`.

## Installation
### Installing censusxy
The easiest way to get `censusxy` is to install it from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("censusxy")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("chris-prener/censusxy")
```

### Installing Suggested Dependencies
Since the package does not need `sf` for its basic functionality, it is a suggested dependency rather than a required one. However, many users will want to map these data as `sf` objects, and we therefore recommend users install `sf`. Windows and macOS users should be able to install `sf` without significant issues unless they are building from source. Linux users will need to install several open source spatial libraries to get `sf` itself up and running. 

If you want to use these `sf`, you can either install it individually (faster) or install all of the suggested dependencies at once (slower, will also give you a number of other packages you may or may not want):

```r
## install sf only
install.packages("sf")

## install all suggested dependencies
install.packages("censusxy", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The main [Get started](articles/censusxy.html) article has:

-   some tips on using `censusxy` in different workflows
-   an overview of the packageâ€™s functionality,
-   and considerations for handling computer timeout.
