The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy access to the [U.S.
Census Bureau Geocoding
Tools](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) in `R`. `censusxy`
has also been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only
unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set
exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset into
appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so
that a single object is returned. There is also support for parallel
processing of requests, which can significantly shorten the time it
takes to batch geocode large numbers of addresses.

`censusxy` is described in a 2021 paper in [*Transactions in
GIS*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12741) by
Chris and Branson - please cite the paper if you use `censusxy` in your
work!

## Current Development Status

While the current, core functionality still works, changes in the Census
API caused consistent issues with our unit tests, prompting us to remove
the package from CRAN. As of early 2025, there is no active development
planned for `censusxy`.

## Installation

### Installing censusxy

The easiest way to get `censusxy` is to install it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("censusxy")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed
from GitHub with `remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("chris-prener/censusxy")
```

### Installing Suggested Dependencies

Since the package does not need `sf` for its basic functionality, it is
a suggested dependency rather than a required one. However, many users
will want to map these data as `sf` objects, and we therefore recommend
users install `sf`. Windows and macOS users should be able to install
`sf` without significant issues unless they are building from source.
Linux users will need to install several open source spatial libraries
to get `sf` itself up and running.

If you want to use these `sf`, you can either install it individually
(faster) or install all of the suggested dependencies at once (slower,
will also give you a number of other packages you may or may not want):

``` r
## install sf only
install.packages("sf")

## install all suggested dependencies
install.packages("censusxy", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Usage

The `censusxy` package contains two data sets, `stl_homicides` (*n* =
1,812) and `stl_homicides_small` (*n* = 24), that can be used to
demonstrate the functionality of the package. The `stl_homicides_small`
data is included specifically for quick experimentation, as its small
sample size ensures an expedient response from the API.

To test `censusxy`â€™s functionality, load the package and either of the
sample data sets:

``` r
library(censusxy)

data <- stl_homicides
```

There are two possible variable configurations (`simple` and `full`,
specified using the `output` argument), and two possible output class
types (`dataframe` and `sf`, specified using the `class` argument):

``` r
homicide_sf <- cxy_geocode(data, street = "street_address", city = "city", state = "state", 
    output = "simple", class = "sf")
```

If you request an `sf` object, you easily preview the results with the
[`mapview` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mapview):

``` r
> mapview::mapview(homicide_sf)
```
