Version 1.0.0 brings breaking changes, but adds a ton of new functionality. 
* Full support for all Census Bureau Geographic Tools
* The syntax of `cxy_geocode()` has changed slightly to facilitate new options
* Non-Standard Evaluation (NSE) has been removed
* `censusxy` now only has 1 dependency
* Parallel support added for Unix Platforms

# censusxy 0.1.3

* The `cxy_geocode()` function now includes an option `fill_na`, which is enabled by default. Two fields in the original implementation of the package, `cxy_quality` and `cxy_match`, were returned as empty strings when no match was identified. Now, by default, they will both be returned with `NA` values when there is no match. If you want to return to the original behavior, simply set `fill_na = FALSE` in your function call.
