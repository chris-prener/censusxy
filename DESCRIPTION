Description: Provides access to the U.S. Census Bureau's API for batch geocoding 
    American street addresses (<https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder>).
    The package offers a batch solution for address geocoding, as opposed to geocoding
    a single address at a time. It has also been developed specifically with large 
    data sets in mind - only unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. 
    If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset 
    into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so that 
    a single object is returned.
