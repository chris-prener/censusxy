Description: Provides access to the U.S. Census Bureau's A.P.I for matching American
    street addresses with their longitude and latitude. This includes both single address matching
    as well as batch functionality for multiple addresses. Census geographies can be appended to 
    addresses if desired, and reverse geocoding of point locations to census geographies is also 
    supported.
